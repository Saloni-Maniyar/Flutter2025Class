# Algorithm for creating Doubly Linked List

```
STEP 1 : Initialize the head pointer to NULL.
STEP 2 : Allocate memory for a new node.
STEP 3 : Set the data field of the new node.
STEP 4 : Point the "prev" field of the new node to the current pointer of the linked list.
STEP 5 : Point the "next" field of the new node to NULL.
STEP 6 : Set the current pointer of the linked list to the new node.
STEP 7 : Repeat steps 2-6 until all the desired nodes have been added.
```
