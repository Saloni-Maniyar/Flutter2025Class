# Inserting At Beginning of the list

We can use the following steps to insert a new node at beginning of the double linked list...

```
Step 1 - Create a newNode with given value and newNode → previous as NULL.
Step 2 - Check whether list is Empty (head == NULL)
Step 3 - If it is Empty then, assign NULL to newNode → next and newNode to head.
Step 4 - If it is not Empty then, assign head to newNode → next and newNode to head.
```
