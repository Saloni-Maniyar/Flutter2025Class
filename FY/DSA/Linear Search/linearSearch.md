# Here is an algorithm for linear search:

```
STEP 1: Set the index variable to 0
STEP 2: While the index is less than the length of the list:
        a. If the element at the current index is equal to the search element, return the index
        b. Increment the index by 1
STEP 3 Return -1 if the element was not found

```
