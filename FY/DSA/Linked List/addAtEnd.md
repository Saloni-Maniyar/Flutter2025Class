# Here is an algorithm to add an element at the end of a linked list:

```
STEP 1 : Create a new node with the data to be inserted
STEP 2 : Make the new node's next pointer point to NULL.
STEP 3 : Make the last node's next pointer point to the new node.
STEP 4 : Make the new node's previous pointer point to the last node.
STEP 5 : Make the new node the last node.
STEP 6 : Increment the size of the linked list by one.
```
