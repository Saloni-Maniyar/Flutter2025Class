# Here is an algorithm to traverse a linked list:

```
STEP 1: Initialize a pointer to the head node of the linked list.
STEP 2: Traverse the linked list while the pointer is not NULL.
STEP 3: In each iteration, read the data of the current node and move the pointer to the next node.
STEP 4: At the end of the loop, the pointer will point to the last node of the linked list.
```
