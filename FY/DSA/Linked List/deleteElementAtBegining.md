# Here is an algorithm to delete an element at the beginning of a linked list:

```
STEP 1 : Start traversing the linked list from the head node
STEP 2 : Make the second node the new head node
STEP 3 : Make the second node's previous pointer point to NULL
STEP 4 : Free the memory occupied by the node to be deleted
STEP 5 : Decrement the size of the linked list by one.
```
